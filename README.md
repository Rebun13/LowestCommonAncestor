# LowestCommonAncestor

## Description

You are given a pointer to the root of the binary search tree and two values _v1_ and _v2_. You need to return the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of _v1_ and _v2_ in the binary search tree.

In the diagram above, the lowest common ancestor of the nodes _4 and _6_ is the node _3_. Node _3_ is the lowest node which has nodes _4_ and _6_ as descendants.

## Output

Return the pointer to the node that is the lowest common ancestor of _v1_ and _v2_.

## Input 

The first line contains an integer, _n_, the number of nodes in the tree.
The second line contains _n_ space-separated integers representing _node.data_ values.
The third line contains two space-separated integers, _v1_ and _v2_.
To use the test data, you will have to create the binary search tree yourself. Here on the platform, the tree will be created for you.
